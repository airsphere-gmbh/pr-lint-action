on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, reopened]

jobs:
  pr-lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: morrisoncole/pr-lint-action@v1.0.0
      with:
        title-regex: '#EX-[0-9]+'
        on-failed-title-comment: 'This is just an example. Failed regex: `%regex%`!'
        body-regex: '#EX-[0-9]+'
        on-failed-body-comment: 'This is just an example. Failed regex: `%regex%`!'
        repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"

```
